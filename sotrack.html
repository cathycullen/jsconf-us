  <h1><a href="http://www.condenast.com/">Condé Nast</a>'s Significant Others (SO) Track</h1>

  <p>The Significant Others Track has been a part of the JSConf US tradition since the very first event in 2009. Please make sure to read the following information to ensure you can have the most amount of fun while in Amelia Island (outside of learning JS, of course).</p>

  <p>As an attending Significant Other, you will be able to make use of the available bikes free of charge.
    You are also welcome to join in the poolside and beachside activities and the evening campfires.</p>

  <p>For the following items, you will need a regsitered ticket in order to participate. While the vast majority of the cost of these events is covered for you by the awesome people at <a href="http://www.CondeNast.com/">Condé Nast</a>, we will be requiring a small ticket price for each of the events you will be participating in.</p>


  <h3>Significant Other Meal Ticket (Adult: $350, Child - 12 and under: $175)</h3>
  <p><a class='btn btn-primary' href="http://tickets.jsconf.us/">Buy Now</a></p>
  <p>In supplement to the activities listed below, some significant others have expressed interest in joining for meals with the attendees. If you want to eat with the conference, be sure to purchase a Significant Other meal ticket. This meal ticket provides access to all four social events (3 evening socials and 1 relax.js brunch) as well as breakfast on Wednesday and Friday. Please note that it <strong>does not</strong> provide access to lunch on Wednesday and Friday as it is assumed you will be on the activities below. If you don't have your meal ticket, please <a href="http://tickets.jsconf.us/">pick it up here</a>! We are required by the venue to provide final counts for the event two weeks before the event, as such we will stop selling significant other meal tickets May 8, 2015. As we learned from last year, there will be SO meal tickets available at the door, but at almost twice the cost (Adult: $525; Child $200). <strong>Please, please please, please, please</strong> get your SO tickets before the event so we can plan accordingly. </p>

Visit St. Augustine and dive into more than four centuries of history that owes much to the Spanish and English, to Greeks and Native Americans and African Americans. Stroll the narrow lanes, enter the many museums, visit landmarks such as Castillo de San Marcos, Ponce de Leon's "Fountain of Youth," and the Oldest Wooden Schoolhouse. St. Augustine – a place for history buffs and everyone else.</p>
