  <h2>Extra Meal Tickets for JSConf US 2015</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Vegan Meal Ticket ($20)</h3>
    <p>We have provided vegan specific meals since 2010, every year we end up with almost 90% of those meal uneaten. These meals often cost more than the buffet meals provided to other attendees due to the special requirements to prepare them. If you require a specifically prepared meal, vegan or otherwise, that cannot be serviced as part of a group buffet, we ask that you purchase a Vegan Meal Ticket. With the meal ticket, we will have a specially prepared meal ready for you at every meal and social event. If you have any questions about this, please <a href="mailto:team@jsconf.us"> email us directly.</a></p>

In supplement to the activities some significant others have expressed interest in joining for meals with the attendees. If you want to eat with the conference, be sure to purchase a Significant Other meal ticket.

    <h2 id="transfer">Transferring a Ticket</h2>
    <p>Tickets will not be refunded under any circumstances, but they may be transferred. To transfer the ownership of a JSConf US 2015 ticket, you can simply send the registration link you will receive from Tito and allow the individual you are transferring to to update their information.

    <h2>Why Are You Selling Tickets Before Speakers Are Announced And So Early?</h2>
    <p>Our conference dates are scheduled shortly after the US Federal holiday of Memorial Day, which historically has higher than normal travel costs. We are trying to allow JSConf attendees the ability to book their travel arrangements significantly in advance so as to take advantage of lower prices. We understand that the cost of a conference isn't just the price of the ticket, but also the hotel, travel, ticket, and other miscellaneous items as such we are doing our best to allow you the opportunity to make that as cost-effective as possible. We understand that some people might not be comfortable purchasing a ticket to a conference with little to no insight about what will be presented at the event. We encourage you to review our previous 5 absolutely amazing events and the wonderful track record we have. If that is not enough to convince you, please to bear in mind that we do offer all of the content for free shortly after the event. We apologize for any inconvenience or uncertainty this may cause you, but we are trying to balance the best of all worlds.</p>
