      <h3>Sponsoring Closing Party</h3>
      <p>We started as a team of technologists helping companies to solve complex problems. Our love of all things technology didn't stop there — in our spare time, we were building robots, creating developer events (<a href="http://jsconf.us">JSConf</a>, <a href="http://robotsconf.com">RobotsConf</a>, <a href="http://nodebots.io">NodeBots</a>, etc.), and helping kids. At the same time, our clients started voicing concerns over the challenges of the fast-evolving, high-tech 21<sup>st</sup>-century work environment - and the need for a workforce that could keep pace. So the idea was born: emerging technology consulting with fascinating education, and help build or re-inspire the pipeline of talent that companies need, while giving individuals the drive and skills to succeed.</p>
